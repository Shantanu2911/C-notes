# **C ++**
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. 
## Why Learn C++?
- C++ is one of the most used and popular programming languages.
- C++ is used in making operating systems, embedded systems, and Graphical User Interfaces.
- It is an object-oriented programming language that implements all the OOPs concepts such as **Abstraction**, **Encapsulation**, and **Inheritance**, which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs and providing security.
- It is portable and can be used to create applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
- C++ is easy to learn so that you can choose it as your first programming language.
- It makes programming easy for programmers to switch to C++ because its syntax is similar to C, Java, and C#.

## Features
- C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language.
- One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software.
- C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language. Some of the key features of C++ include:
- Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects.
- Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.
- Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.
- Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.

## Advantages of C++ :
- Simple
- Machine Independent (Platform dependant)
- Mid-level language
- Rich library support
- Speed of execution
- Case-sensitive
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Memory Management
- Multi-threading
- Pointer and direct memory-access
- Object oriented
- Compiled Language

## Disadvantages of C++ :
- Steep Learning Curve
- Verbose Syntax
- Error-Prone
